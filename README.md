## Key Features
1. **Data Generation**: The dataset is created using Python's NumPy and Pandas libraries with realistic distributions.
2. **Data Exploration**: Basic exploration includes checking for null values, value counts for categorical variables, and summary statistics.
3. **Data Visualization**: Histograms are used to visualize the distribution of age and years of experience.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Additional columns like 'Age' and 'Name' are added to enhance the dataset.
